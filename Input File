  2. (a) The polar coordinates of a point are ( r, ?) = ( 10.65 cm, 128.3 o). Find the Cartesian coordinates of this point. (b) Convert ( x, y) = (- 9.11 cm, - 7.37 cm) to polar coordinates. 
 
  
 
  3. Velocity of a particle moving along the x axis starts from + 7.6 m/s and decreases steadily to â€“ 5.0 m/s in 5.1 s. Then it increases steadily to 3.7 m/s in 7.1 s. What was its average velocity during the total time of travel?  
 
  
 
  4. An eagle travels 131.3 m with an initial velocity of 19.7 m/s in the direction of North for 11.45 s. What was eagleâ€™s acceleration, assuming that it remained constant during that time?
 
  
 
  5. A metal ball is thrown straight up with an initial speed of 8.08 m/s from a window which is 29.2 m above the ground. What is the time for the ball to reach the ground?
 
  
 
  6. A submarine drifted 29.5 km in the direction of 40.3 degrees S of W and then advanced 21.6 km in the direction of 22.7 degrees E of N. Find its displacement in the Cartesian and polar system of coordinates.
 
  
 
  7. A car travels 6.7 km East, 8.6 km South, 5.5 km West, and 10.0 km North. (a) Make a drawing that shows all the displacements, as well as the total displacement. (b) What is the magnitude and the direction of the total vector of displacement? (c) What is the total distance traveled? (d) Extra Credit (two points) If the car had an initial speed of 9.8 m/s and a constant acceleration of 4.3.65 m/s4.3, what was the average speed during the travel? 
 
  
 
  8. A rock is thrown from the edge of the top of a 47.3 m tall building at some unknown angle above the horizontal. The rock strikes the ground a horizontal distance of 35.8 m from the base of the building. Assume that the ground is horizontal and that the side of the building is vertical. If its speed is 69.3 m/s just before it hits the ground, how much time is it in the air? 
 
  
 
  9. (a)	The net force acting on a mower which is moving horizontally is 49.6 N. If Mary exerts the force of 65.9 N on the mower, what is the force of friction acting on the mover?(b)If the mowerâ€™s acceleration is 4.51 m/s4.3, what is its mass?(c)If Maryâ€™s mass is 56.3 kg, what is the force of friction acting on her?(d)The mower kept on moving for 6.15 m even after Mary stopped pushing until it came to rest. What was its speed right before Mary stopped pushing? 
 
  
 
  10. A motionless spider is hanging on a vertical strand of spider web that has a tension force of 4.3.3 N. (a) What is the spiderâ€™s mass? (b) What was the tension force in the strand when the spider started climbing up the strand with an acceleration of 8.74.3 m/s4.3?
