# Test-Generator-for-Teachers

The purpose of this Python program is to create different versions of a text file by randomizing the numbers found in the file.

The user specifies how many versions of the text file they want, and the program finds all the numbers and randomizes each of them in the text file. For every text file the user wants to randomize, the program downlaods a new file to your computer with different randomized numbers.
